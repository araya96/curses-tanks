# Tank Game
## Nycole and Ariana

## Overview
The objective of this two player game is to hit your opponent with missiles.  But be careful - you can also hit yourself.  Three hits and it’s **GAME OVER** :collision: :fire:

Use the arrow keys to adjust the power and angle of your shot.  When you’re ready to fire, just hit enter.  Watch out; the missiles leave craters behind - and the landscape changes every time a player is hit. :bomb:

If you're afraid the other player might hit you, just re-randomize your position! That makes it so every choice counts!

Look out for the wind! The wind always changes direction based on who gets hit. Try to use it to your advantage! Just be sure not to hit yourself in the process . . . :innocent:
If you can't handle the wind, just change it's strength by pressing 'w'. **It won't change directions**, but it can help.

Good luck! :wink: :sunglasses:
