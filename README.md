# Tank Game
## Nycole and Ariana

The objective of this two player game is to hit your opponent with missiles.  But be careful - you can also hit yourself.  Three hits and it’s **GAME OVER** :collision: :fire:

Use the arrow keys to adjust the power and angle of your shot.  When you’re ready to fire, just hit enter.  But watch out; there's wind - and the landscape changes every time a player is hit.

Look out for the wind! The wind always points west, which is to the right. This can be a disadvantage, but be sure to use it to your advantage! Just be sure not to hit yourself in the process . . . :innocent:

Good luck! :wink: :sunglasses:
